This directory contains scripts to build the test application using
OCaml. You also need CamlIDL to be able to generate the OCAML API.

- To download OCaml:
   http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/      

- To download CamlIDL
  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/camlidl

- One must build the OCaml library before compiling the example.
  Go to directory ../ocaml

- Use 'build-test.sh <OCAMLLIB>' to build the test application using OCaml compiler.
  Example:
  ./build-test.sh /usr/local/lib/ocaml
  
- Use 'exec.sh' to execute test_mlapi. The script sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and invokes test_mlapi.

The build-test.sh script was written by Ming Kawaguchi. Many thanks to him!
