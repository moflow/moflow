*** Supported platforms ***

In general, we support Debian Stable, Debian Testing, and Ubuntu.  You
can probably compile BAP on other distributions, but it might require
small changes.

*** Basic pre-requisites:

* ocaml v where 3.12 <= v < 4.01.00
* camlidl
* camomile
* bfd

*** Basic installation ****

To build BAP on x86, do the following:
  $ ./autogen.sh (if building from git)
  $ ./configure
  $ make
-- or to make all and run unit tests after --
  $ make test

Configure should report any dependencies you do not have.

*** Installation on Ubuntu 11.04/11.10/12.04 and Debian squeeze/wheezy ***

Run the following command to install required packages:

# __BEGIN_REQUIRED__
  sudo apt-get -y install ocaml-nox ocaml-native-compilers ocaml-findlib \
  camlidl binutils-dev automake libcamomile-ocaml-dev otags libpcre3-dev \
  camlp4-extra bison flex zlib1g-dev libgmp3-dev g++ libtool make
# __END_REQUIRED__

On x86_64 also add:
  $ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib lib32z1-dev

To build LLVM code generation, include:
  $ sudo apt-get install libllvm-3.1-ocaml-dev
We believe that llvm versions 3.1 to 3.3 should work, but this is not
widely tested.

To compile the documentation, add:
  $ sudo aptitude install texlive-base texlive-latex-base \
    texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended mathpartir

On Debian squeeze, you must also install a new version of OCaml.
Follow the instructions in "Bootstrapping using ocamlbrew" after
installing the appropriate packages above.

*** Bootstrapping using ocamlbrew ***

To install ocaml 4.00.1 and opam using ocamlbrew:
  $ curl -kL https://raw.github.com/hcarty/ocamlbrew/master/ocamlbrew-install | env OCAMLBREW_FLAGS="-r" bash

Follow the directions printed on the screen about adding 'source
<...>' to your ~/.bashrc file to make ocaml available whenever you
start a shell.  Also run the 'source <...>' line in your shell to make
ocaml available in your current session.

At this point, running the following command should print version 3.12
or newer, indicating you are using ocaml from ocamlbrew:
  $ ocaml -version

Next, install the required ocaml packages using opam:
  $ opam install ocamlfind camomile camlidl otags

If you are installing on Debian/Ubuntu and used the above apt-get
command to install packages, you should be able to build bap normally
now (./autogen && ./configure && make).

On any other system, you will need to use a special command line that
tells bap where opam packages are:
  $ ./autogen.sh # (if building from git)
  $ CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/ -I$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    INCDIRS="$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -L/opt/local/lib/x86_64/" \
    ./configure

After this, run make normally.

*** Installation for Fedora Core 15 ***

Run the following command to install required packages:
  $ sudo yum install ocaml ocaml-ocamlgraph ocaml-findlib   \
    ocaml-camlidl-devel ocaml-ocamlgraph-devel ocaml-extlib \
    ocaml-camomile-devel ocaml-camomile-data                \
    ocaml-camlp4-devel automake binutils-devel gcc-c++

*** Installation for Mac OS X ***

Install macports from https://www.macports.org/install.php

Install required packages using macports:
(For binutils, we build from source in order to specify supported targets.)
  $ port install gmp autoconf automake libtool ocaml opam pcre
  $ port install -s binutils configure.post_args="--enable-targets=i386-darwin,i386-linux,i386-pe,x86_64-darwin,x86_64-linux,x86_64-pe,arm-linux,mips-linux,mipsle-linux"

Alternatively, install required packages using homebrew:
  $ brew install gmp autoconf automake libtool ocaml opam pcre gettext binutils

If using opam for the first time:
  $ opam init

Make sure to copy the suggested line to your ~/.profile and execute it.

Install required opam packages:
  $ opam install ocamlfind camlidl camomile otags

For LLVM code generation, also install these packages:
  $ opam install llvm

If building from git, generate the configure script:
  $ ./autogen.sh

Run configure when using macports:
  $ CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/ -I$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    INCDIRS="$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -L/opt/local/lib/x86_64/ -lintl" \
    ./configure

If you encounter the error "configure: error: Iberty library not found" during
configure, then your installation of binutils is affected by a recent bug in
binutils (https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15815). Until the next
stable release of binutils (post 2.24) is released and until macports supports
this release, we recommend installing gcc 4.7 in macports as a workaround:

  $ port install gcc47

After installing gcc 4.7, rerun configure as shown above but substitute
"-L/opt/local/lib/x86_64/" with "-L/opt/local/lib/gcc47/x86_64/" in LDFLAGS.

Run configure when using homebrew:
  $ CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/ -I$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    INCDIRS="$(opam config var lib)/camlidl" \
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib/x86_64/ \
    -L/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib -lintl" \
    ./configure

Finally, run make normally.

*** SMT Solvers ***

BAP interfaces with several SMT solvers which must be downloaded and
installed separately.  The solver utility must be in the executable
path to be available to BAP. The supported solvers are:
 * STP https://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/
 * cvc3 http://www.cs.nyu.edu/acsys/cvc3/
 * yices2 http://yices.csl.sri.com/

BAP also supports z3 through its native ocaml library, avavilable here:
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html
Once downloaded and extracted, use the BAP configure --with-z3=z3-dir
option, where z3-dir is the extracted z3 directory.  Note that you must
run the z3-dir/ocaml/build-lib.sh script before configuring.  The getz3.sh
script in the solvers directory of the BAP distribution will download,
extract z3 to solvers/z3, and run the build-lib script for you.  If
you use this script, you must then pass --with-z3=bap-dir/solvers/z3
to configure, replacing bap-dir with the path of your BAP directory.

*** Installing PIN ***

The PIN trace tool is located in the pintraces/ directory. Because of
licensing reasons, we cannot distribute PIN with the trace tool. PIN
must be extracted inside of the BAP directory; for instance, if BAP is
located in $BAPDIR, then PIN should be in $BAPDIR/pin. Running
./getpin.sh from the $BAPDIR/pintraces directory will automatically
download and install PIN for Linux; the user is responsible for
accepting the PIN license agreements. On Windows, PIN must be
downloaded and extracted by hand. The PIN tool can be built by
executing make in the $PATH/traces/experiemental directory.  On
Windows, we reccomend using GNU Make for Windows
(http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) and Visual C++
2010 express
(http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express).
After compilation, the PIN tool should exist in
$PATH/traces/pintraces/obj-ia32/gentrace.so (or gentrace.dll on
Windows).  See the documentation for more detail.

*** Optional: Making the documentation ***

Optionally you can also build the developer documentation by running:
'make doc' in the ocaml directory.  The documentation will be
generated under ocaml/doc/bap/.  Note that ocaml documentation
requires that the ocaml source files be built properly first.

*** Optional: Making unit tests ***

Build and run the unit tests tests:
  $ make test

OR

  $ cd tests && make && ./bap_test_suite

For verbose output, pass -verbose to bap_test_suite.
